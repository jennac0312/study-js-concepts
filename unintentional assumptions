things i unintentionally and wrongfully assume is common knowledge.. that i don't realize until i type and think ... "wait, that's not something people just know"


so here i am leaving a list of simple questions that i will clarify if i can lol (because these are also things that you might think you know until you actually have to explain and then suddenly you fumble over your words)



1. variables can only be declared once

2. what is console.log() ?

3. keywords... and that they are ignored (not seen as keywords) when used in strings

4. what does return mean? when we talk about methods and properties 'returning' something.

5. why file names should be camelCase also. (and understanding when/why they sometimes will be uppercase)

6. weird things about JS. like counting from 0... not just in arrays, also in strings and i think everywhere

7.
